Fruit Collector

In this project, we have created a fruit collector as seen in Figure 1. This fruit collector is a robot manipulator that has three joints, an end-effector that collects the fruits, a base, and four wheels that help the robot move to the locations when needed. This robot’s task is to grab two different types of fruits, oranges and apples, that are located in different positions throughout three trees and drop them in the basket. The scene is set up in 3D with an interface to pick which fruit to collect as two buttons and the availability of movement of the angle perspective (camera) with the user’s mouse. During the collecting cycle, the interface shows a description of the steps occurring while in the scene the camera is panning in different angles in order to show all the different perspectives.
